## Expanding & Fading Rotating Boxes Animation

---

This animation creates multiple boxes that appear from the center of the screen (or a smaller size), rotate, expand, and then fade out. It's a visually appealing effect often used for intros, background effects, or animated loaders.

- Starts small at the center or initial size.

- Rotates while growing in size.

- Fades out gradually until fully invisible.

- Built using only CSS keyframes and transforms.
